```{r include=FALSE}
etude2::load_learnr_safely()
library(etude2)
```


##  {.tabset}

### Problem One

I don't think I need to use the `{learnr}` prompt. Why not just use regular text?
```{r first, echo=FALSE, results="markup"}
etude2::etudeQ(
  "",
  "Wow" = "Upside down",
  "+Mom+"= "That's always the right question!",
  "Mow" = "Simply wrong",
  "Wom" = "Wrong in so many ways!"
)
```

### Problem Two

<div style="width: 400px; padding-left: 80px;">

```{r second, echo=FALSE, results="markup"}
etude2::etudeQ(
  "Another question entirely?",
  "Wow" = "Upside down",
  "+Mom+"= "That's always the right question!",
  "Mow" = "Simply wrong",
  "Wom" = "Wrong in so many ways!"
)
```

</div>
